    "1. **Trained YOLOv8 model** for trash detection\n",
    "2. **Model weights** saved at: `models/TrashCAN_YoloV8_Jupyter/trashcan_detection/weights/best.pt`\n",
    "3. **Training plots** showing loss curves and metrics\n",

    "5. **Exported model** in ONNX format for deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Use the trained model in your main application\n",
    "- Integrate with your existing `inference.py`\n",
    "- Deploy for real-time trash detection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Performance:\n",
    "The model will detect 14 different types of trash:\n",
